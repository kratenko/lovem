# Becoming social

__A new way for you to participate in my journey.__

After a few days of progress on the project itself, I spent a bit of time on the site again. 
We have the fancy link to our GitHub repo in the upper right corner now. But more important, 
I added support for comments on my entries. You can now react and ask questions or 
share your thought.

I am using [giscus.app][giscus] (and, again, I copied that idea from @squidfunk and their site 
on [mkdocs-material][mkdocs-material], which is what I did for this complete site, more or less).
Giscus is an open source app that stores the comments completely inside GitHub discussions, 
so the content is stored along the *lovem* repository and at the one place where everything is 
stored already anyway. If you want to participate in the comments, you need to log in using your 
GitHub account. That is great, because I don't need to care about user management, nor about any database.

Feel free to use this entry to try out the new feature, because that is what I am gonna do!
