# Let there be source code

__Finally, I will be showing some source code. Not directly in the journal, 
but I will link you to GitHub, for a start.__

I have written code. And this time, I (re-)started lovem in a public git repository, 
so you can see what I do, if you are interested. And I hope it puts enough pressure
on me, to keep on the project for a while.

In fact, there is quite a bit of code there already. I started coding, before writing 
any of this, and it went so well. I like how it feels. I was working any hour I 
could spare. When a friend asked me what I was doing, I started a somewhat 
complex backstory why I was doing it, instead of actually explaining anything of the 
stuff I was doing &ndash; and was interrupted quite early, so there was more to tell in me still. 
The next day, I sat down and started to write all of that down as a little story. I wanted to 
put it somewhere, so I started this journal to publish it. And I decided to do it in 
blog form, so I am publishing that background story bit by bit.

So, as of writing this, there is a lot of work completed on the VM. Tt is amazing what 
things it can do for how little code there is. When this post goes public, there should be 
quite lot more done...

## But where is the code?
Well, if you read this journal, you will know where it lives. Anyway, this is the repo:

https://kratenko.github.io/lovem/

I plan to continue sharing my thoughts while I work on the VM. So you will be able to 
follow my failures and see the attempts that I will be ditching later. I think the 
format of this journal can work out, but we will see how I like it over time. It will be 
behind on progress, as I want to take time to share things as they unfold. And this should 
help to produce a somewhat continuous publication stream. Git being what git is, should support
me in showing you the things I do back in time, using the power of commits.

As things are with blogs, my entries will be very different, depending on what I want to tell 
and on what I did. So far most blogs where conceptional thinking, some research, and a lot of 
blabla, which I tell because it interests me myself. In the future, there should be concrete 
problems I find and solve in source code - or which I fail to solve.

## Back in time
Me original first commit was way too late and contained way too much code. Also, I did not 
plan to show it to you like this, back then. So, as mentioned before, I rolled back and 
started again, with more commits. And I am keeping tags now, so that I have well-defined versions
for my blog posts. That should make it easy for you to follow up, if you want to.

The new, artificial "first commit" is now a tag/release: [v0.0.1-journey][v0.0.1-journey]. You can 
view the code for any tag online, this one you will find under: 

https://github.com/kratenko/lovem/tree/v0.0.1-journey

I think this will be a theme of this journal: linking you to what I did, when I am writing about it.
And I will try to share my trails of thoughts, leading to my decisions (and errors, as it will be).
I will do that, for that v0.0.1-journey, soon, don't worry, I will explain everything I did. But
the next journal entry will be about some decisions again; mainly about the language I am using.

[v0.0.1-journey]: https://github.com/kratenko/lovem/releases/tag/v0.0.1-journey
