# All new once more

__Reality strikes again, and code will be written from scratch once more. And the reason is this site.__

You want me to get to the code. And I really should. I have written so much already, and I want to show it, 
but there is so much around it. And after I had written up a long text on how I started, I realised that I 
had no commits during the early state. So I had to write it all again, slower, and with code to be 
presentable in this journal.

If you are reading this live (and no-one is, because I did not even tell anyone I am doing this), you can 
of course look at the code I was writing earlier, it exists. I put it in a branch [`too-early`][too-early]. 
But I will not give explanations to that. I am rewriting it on the master branch, and that will be showed and 
discussed in the journal. I advise you to wait for that.

Yes, it will take a while. As it looks now, it will be slow. But I have written some new posts on the new 
code already, and I think it is worth it. There will be more background before we get there. Next entry will 
be a longer one, so there is that.
