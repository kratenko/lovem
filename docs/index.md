# The Journey towards lovem
This is a journal for my journey towards building 
a **the low overhead virtual embedded machine**.

What that is and why I started building it will come clear from the entries in this journal.

## lovem
Lovem is meant to become a virtual machine for use in constrained embedded devices. 
It was started by me, @kratenko, for reasons I am writing about in this journal

You can find lovem on github: <br>
https://github.com/kratenko/lovem

You will find it in whatever state it is currently in. As I know myself, it might never get anywhere 
from today. But for the last days at least it was a project I spent quite some time on, mainly for 
self educational reasons.

## me
If for some reason you want to contact me, you can find me on 
twitter [@garstenko][garstenko] or of course on github as :octicons-mark-github-16: @kratenko.
