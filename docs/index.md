# The Journey towards Lovem
This is a journal for my journey towards building 
a **the low overhead virtual embedded machine**.

What that is and why I started building it will come clear from the entries in this journal.
For some reason I feel the need to add the history of lovem's creation (so far) to it. 
So I wrote down the history of it before I recently came back to it in three articles, 
which I then shamelessly split into multiple shorter posts, so I have more to publish.
This is new to me, let's see what will happen!

My work on lovem so far has been focused on self education. Why not share my insights?
I hope it will be useful to someone &ndash; maybe even for my future self?

## Lovem
Lovem is meant to become a virtual machine for use in constrained embedded devices. 
It was started by me, @kratenko, for reasons I am writing about in this journal

You can find lovem on github: <br>
https://github.com/kratenko/lovem

## Me
If for some reason you want to contact me, you can find me on 
twitter [@garstenko][garstenko] or of course on github as :octicons-mark-github-16: @kratenko.

## This site
So I quickly googled `mkdocs blog` to find some sensible way to document my journey online. 
https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/ was not quite what I was looking for. 
It is the blog of @squidfunk the guy who writes [Material for MkDocs][material], where he 
blogs about his work on Material for MkDocs. He (unsurprisingly) does this with the help of 
Material for MkDocs. But it looks like he is doing his blog posts by hand, or, what I 
suspect, using a tool that he does not publish, yet (or I was too blind to find).

So I did the most logical thing to do:

 * Check out his repo for easy source viewing.
 * Copy/paste as much of his blog design as I figure out and get to work during investing dozens 
   of minutes.
 * Build the site and throw it out to a github-page for my project.

So, big shout out to @squidfunk for their work!

So I might just find the time and motivation, to give this journal a bit more of a personal touch;
and hopefully some automation for creating my blog posts, soon. Then again, I might not. 
The content is online, and that is what is most important.
