# Lovem
**The low overhead virtual embedded machine.**

The goal is, to write a virtual machine to be used in restricted 
embedded systems (on microcontrollers). Aimed features are:

- Small compiled program size of VM itself.
- Small size of compiled programs to run on VM.
- Small memory footprint during execution.
- Robust runtime.
- Efficient bit/byte manipulation in programs.

# The journey
I am developing *lovem* publicly on GitHub. The journey is documented 
on [https://kratenko.github.io/lovem](https://kratenko.github.io/lovem).
I try to explain how a virtual stack machine works and also explain some 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on the way.

The process slows down development of the VM quite a lot. But I like the 
pace it is currently taking.

Entries link to GitHub releases/tags, so that you can easily follow the 
code, if you clone the repository locally.

# License
I have not decided, yet. I will be aiming for something permissive, so you 
can use it in commercial products and for your privat education. That means 
the program code and such. The journal entries (aka dev blog posts) are the 
owned by there authors (that would be me), which all implications you get 
from published texts. That means, you can quote them.

# Participate
Direct participation is difficult, at this stage, as I develop a plan as I 
go along, that can be followed in the blog. I will see issues and pull 
requests, I guess, but I don't know how I will handle them for now. 
If you read the journey entries (blog posts), there is the possibility 
to add comments and ask questions. You can also use GitHub discussions. 
Actually, the comments on the journal also live in discussions.
