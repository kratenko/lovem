# a very simple lovem assembly program for lovem v0.0.4-journey
# lines starting with # are comments
    # there can be whitespaces before the #
nop  # you can have comments at the end of a line, after the instruction

# empty lines are ignored
push_u8 100
   push_u8   77   # multiple whitespaces are like a single one
add
pop
fin

# program will never get here, after `fin`, but the assembler will, so
# there must not be syntax errors here

# comments are fine, of course.
